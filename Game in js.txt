Game Rules 
Rock, paper, scissors is a classic game of chance for two people. You and a partner shake your fists 3 times and then make gestures at random to show a rock, paper or scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper and paper beats rock (it wraps the rock!).

If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually replayed to break the tie.
